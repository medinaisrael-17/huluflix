# HuluFlixPrime+

"HuluFlixPrime+" is a static webpage that showcases my ability to work with pure css and html. The idea came from my love of shows and film. Currently, streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and now Disney+, are the most convenient way to enjoy media. I took the layout from these sites to try and recreate a landing page that looks similar to these websites.
